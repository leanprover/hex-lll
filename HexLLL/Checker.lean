/-- Working precision (bits) of the interval reducedness checker. The
inequalities being certified carry slack by design: the dispatch requests a
`(requestedDelta δ, requestedEta)`-reduced basis but certifies it against the
weaker `(δ, 11/20)`, so size reduction clears `11/20` by `11/20 − requestedEta`
and Lovász clears `δ` by `(requestedDelta δ − δ)·d[i+1]²`. A fixed precision
decides them on a correctly-reduced candidate; any indecision falls back to
the exact checker rather than failing. The 128-bit width is fixed (independent
of input size) and chosen to comfortably exceed the per-step slack margins for
the documented input families, keeping every enclosure at a small, predictable
arithmetic cost. -/

/-- Fixed-precision interval reducedness checker. Computes enclosures of
the Gram-Schmidt data of `b` from its exact integer Gram matrix and accepts
only when every independence, size-reduction, and Lovász inequality is
decided with the enclosure strictly on the correct side. `false` means
"not reduced or indecisive at this precision": callers must fall back to
the exact checker `lllReduced`, which keeps completeness structural.
Soundness (`lllReducedInterval_sound`, HexLLLMathlib) entails
`b.independent ∧ isLLLReduced b δ η` at the exact rational parameters. -/

/-- Executable integer `Bool` reducedness checker over the `GramSchmidt.Int`
representation: leading Gram determinants `d` and integer scaled Gram-Schmidt
coefficients `ν`.

Verifies, over integer arithmetic only:

* **independence**: every `d[k+1]` is positive (`k < n`);
* **size-reduced at `η`**: `η.den · |ν[i][j]| ≤ η.num · d[j+1]` for all `j < i`
  — the integer form of `|μ| ≤ η`;
* **integer Lovász at `δ`**: `δ.den · (d[i+2] · d[i] + ν[i+1][i]²) ≥
  δ.num · d[i+1]²` for all `i + 1 < n`.

No validity hypothesis on `η` is required: a malformed `η` (e.g. negative) is
incompatible with a positive `d[j+1]` and the size-reduced bound, so the
checker simply returns `false`. Soundness
(`lllReduced_sound`, HexLLLMathlib) bridges to the rational predicate
`isLLLReduced` via the integer correspondence
(`Hex.GramSchmidt.Int.scaledCoeffs_eq`, `basis_normSq`, `gramDet_pos`).
`δ` and `η` default to the classical `3/4` and `1/2`, so `lllReduced b` tests
textbook LLL-reducedness (the bound `lllNative` achieves). -/

/-- Dispatch threshold of the size predictor `intervalWins`, as a multiple
of the working precision. Derived from the per-operation cost ratio of the
two checkers: the exact `d`/`ν` checker performs ~`n³/3` multiplications on
operands averaging ~`n·maxDiagBits/4` bits, while the interval pass
performs ~`n³/6` products on fixed `(intervalPrec + maxDiagBits)`-bit
mantissas, so enclosures win once `n·maxDiagBits` exceeds a fixed multiple
of `intervalPrec + maxDiagBits`. On the two committed bench families this
crosses over between n=25 and n=30 for harsh-cubic and between n=150 and
n=180 for random-bounded (paired bench on `carica`). The boundary rungs are
entangled: lowering the constant to pull harsh-cubic n=25 (where the
interval pass runs ~10% faster, about 0.5 ms) onto the interval side also
pulls random-bounded n=150 there, where the exact checker runs ~2% faster.
On that ~360 ms rung the ~7 ms cost outweighs the harsh-cubic saving, so the
constant stays at the value that keeps random-bounded n=150 on the exact
side and minimizes total absolute misroute cost across both families. -/

/-- `Nat.log2` (floor of the base-2 log) of the largest squared row norm. The
Gram diagonal dominates all Gram entries by Cauchy-Schwarz, so this single scalar
bounds the operand size of every checker and reducer pass. `O(n·m)` work —
negligible against either. A deterministic function of the input alone, so the
dispatches that read it keep per-input timing deterministic. -/

/-- Size predictor for the reducedness dispatch: `true` when the

checker on this input. Reads only `maxDiagBits`, so the predictor is a

timing deterministic. -/

/-- Reducedness clause of the certified dispatch. On the same integer
`d`/`ν` data, two checkers can decide reducedness: the exact integer
checker `lllReduced`, always complete, and a faster fixed-precision
interval pass. The size predictor `intervalWins` picks which to run first;
when the interval pass is indecisive it falls back to the exact checker,
so completeness stays structural rather than numerical. Records each
decision in the checker tally, distinguishing all three outcomes. -/

Composes the Mathlib-free Bool checkers `Matrix.sameLatticeCert` and
`lllReducedCheck` (interval decision with exact `lllReduced` fallback).
Soundness (`certCheck_sound`, HexLLLMathlib) entails the property triple
`(same lattice, B' independent, isLLLReduced B' δ η)` and is the single
trusted bridge that the certified-dispatch path of `lll` depends on. -/
